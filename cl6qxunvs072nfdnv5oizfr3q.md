## Life as developer

6 years ago , when I started to learn how to code ,I did not imagine that this bring me just
joy and peace.
l read so many times that you should hold your happiness private ,but I can not resist .
Now I want to say that as times goes by I feel more and more love with coding .

I never feel tired ,bored  or negetivity.All are joy ,peace and happiness .
This is my short first post .

Thanks for reading .
